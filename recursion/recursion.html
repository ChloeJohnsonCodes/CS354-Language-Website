    <h1>Recursion in C++</h1>
    <h3>Author: Chinwendum Njoku</h3>
    <p>When a function is called within the same function, it is known as recursion in C++. The function which calls the same function is known as recursive function.</p>
    <h3>Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
    <p> The fibonacci sequence is a peculiar series of numbers named after an Italian mathematician called Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa, or Leonardo Bigollo Pisano. 
      Fibonacci series is a series of numbers formed by the addition of the two preceding numbers in the series starting from 0 and 1. Fib(0) = 0 base case 1 and Fib(1) = 1 base case 2.
      The current number is computed by adding the two previous terms. Example: 0,1,1,2,4,6,10,16 etc. In this case, the first two terms are 0 and 1 which is then added to get the third.
      The fourth number is computed by adding the second and third. The sequence continues until the nth term is reached. The formula is F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).
      Recursion is defined in terms of itself or of its type.
