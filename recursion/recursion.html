    <p>***Brief explanation on the fibonacci sequence***</p>
    <p> The fibonacci sequence is a peculiar series of numbers named after italian mathematician called Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa, or Leonardo Bigollo Pisano. 
      Fobonacci series is a series of numbers formed by the addition of the two preceding numbers in the series starting from 0 and 1. Fib(0) = 0 base case 1 and Fib(1) = 1 base case 2.
      The preceding number is gotten by adding the two previous terms. Example: 0,1,1,2,4,6,10,16 etc. In this case, the first two terms are 0 and 1 which is then added to get the third.
      The fourth number can be gotten by adding the second and third. The sequence continues until the nth term is reached. The formula is F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). 
      Recursion is when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.
