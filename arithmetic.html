    <h1>Arithmetic in C++</h1>
    <h3>Author: Chloe Johnson</h3>
    <p> This is a basic function that uses the modulo operator to determine
      if a number is prime in C++. It takes one parameter, number. Then it
      it loops through every possible value that number could be divided by.
      If zero is returned from the operation on number and i, the number isn't
      prime. Otherwise, it's a prime number.

      <pre>
        <code>
          bool isPrime(int number) {
              for(int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
                  if ((number%i) == 0) {
                      return false;
                  }
              }
              return true;
          }
        </code>
        <samp>
          Output:

          Enter a number to check if it's prime: 12
          12 is not a prime number.

          Enter a number to check if it's prime: 23
          23 is a prime number.
