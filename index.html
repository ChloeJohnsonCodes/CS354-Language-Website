<h3>C++ History</h3>
  <p>The roots of C++ start with a danish computer scientist, Bjarne Stroustrup. Before C++, Stroustrup was writing his PHD thesis in the 1960s
  concerning a language called Simula.  The purpose of Simula was to simulate discrete event simulations or systems.
  To do so, it required that that these systems encapsulated their definitions, properties and actions. Simula is regarded as the first
  language to support the object orientated programming paradigm (Dahl, Nygaard, 1965), but it lacked the performance required by Stroustrup's work.
  Stroustrup continued with the idea of object orientated software and went on to create what was then called <q>C with Classes</q> (Stroustrup 1996).
  This combined his PHD work on Simula and the idea of classes with the speed and low-level functionality of C. The first C with Classes compiler was called
  Cfront. It was a program designed to translate C with Classes code to ordinary C. In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++.
  In 1985, Stroustrup's reference to the language , The C++ Programming Language, was published.
