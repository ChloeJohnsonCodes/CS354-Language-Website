    <h3>Perplexing Pointers in C++</h3>
    <p>Pointers are seen in languages such as BASIC, C, and C#. C++ also contains pointers, so it's important that C++ programmers understand how pointers are used. A pointer is an object that stores a memory address. Therefore, pointers can be used to reference a location in memory. In this program, it's shown how pointers reference addresses, how pointers are dereferenced, and how pointer arithmetic is performed.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
            #include &ltiostream&gt

            int main() {
            
                /* This program assigns addresses to pointers, dereferences pointers, and performs
                 * pointer arithmetic.
                 */
                 
                int a = 2, b = 10, c = 22;
                int *pointer1, *pointer2, *pointer3;
                pointer1 = &a;
                pointer2 = &b;
                pointer3 = &c;
                a = *pointer1 * *pointer2 * *pointer3;
                b = *pointer1 + *pointer2 + *pointer3;
                c = *pointer1 - *pointer2 - *pointer2;
                pointer1++; // Changing the location of the pointer. a can no longer be referenced by pointer1
                pointer3 = pointer2; // pointer2 is assigned to pointer3. Now pointer3 references b.
                std::cout << "a location: " << &a << " pointer1 location: " << pointer1 << " pointer1: " << *pointer1 << std::endl;
                std::cout << "b location: " << &b << " pointer2 location: " << pointer2 << " pointer2: " << *pointer2 << std::endl;
                std::cout << "c location: " << &c << " pointer3 location: " << pointer3 << " pointer3: " << *pointer3 << std::endl;
                return 0;
            }
