    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe in C++</h1>
    <h3>Authors: Hannah Jacobson, Chloe Johnson, Chinwendum Njoku, Ian Whitney</h3>
    <p>In this project, we explored object-oriented programming conecepts and game development 
      through C++. Given the team's interest in game developmet, we decided to create TicTacToe for our final project with C++. While the differences between using C++ and Java aren't obvious in this project, C++ performs faster than Java and it has extensive libraries that can used for graphics. One of the main differences between C++
      and other object-oriented programming languages is that C++ is cross compatible. It can run on Xbox and Playstation. Therefore, C++ is a language that all game developers should know. Although we didn't have time
      to explore the graphics library in C++, we were able to create TicTacToe because of its simplicity and short duration. In the future, improvements could be made regarding the user interface.</p>
