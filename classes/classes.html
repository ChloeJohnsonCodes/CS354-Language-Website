    <h1>Classes in C++</h1>
    <h3>Author: Hannah Jacobson</h3>
    <p>C++ implements the creation of classes alongside the majority of C's features. These classes allow C++ to incorperate 
      encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.. Methods and public variables from a class are accessed with dot syntax 
      (i.e. square.foo()) and the content of a class can be hidden from the user by used one of the three access specifiers: 
      public, private, or protected. Subclasses can inherit methods and attributes from one or more parent classes, 
      differentiating it from other object-oriented languages like Java.</p>
    <h3>Wallet Header</h3>
    <p>The Wallet header file is where I've declared the Wallet class. The class has one private variable for each wallet's 
      balance. To see or change the balance, a programmer will have to use the public methods getBalance, setBalance, or withdraw.</p>
    <p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            	class Wallet {
		private:                        //This is an access specifier
			int balance;                //Everything listed after it is private
        
		public:                         //Now, everything listed after "public:" is public!
			Wallet();                   //Wallet declaration
        
			int getBalance();           //Return the current value held in balance
    
			void setBalance(int val);   //Set the balance to be an integer value
    
			void withdraw(int val);     //Remove an integer value from the balance
	};
        </code>
      </pre>

    <h3>Wallet Class</h3>
    <p>After a class has been declared - whether in it's own file or simply outside a main function - the 
      class methods can be defined inside the class or elsewhere. In order to define a method outside the class, 
      you need to use the scope resolution modifier "::" with the method's name to associate it with its class.</p>
    <p>The Wallet class file uses this method to define each method from the Wallet header file.</p>
    <p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            	#include "Wallet.h"                 //Remember to include the header file!
        
	Wallet::Wallet(){
		balance = 0;                    //Initialize our class variables
	}        

	/* We access balance with these methods for 
 	  encapsulation!
 	  */
	int Wallet::getBalance(){
		return balance;                 
	}

	void Wallet::setBalance(int val){
		balance = val;
	}
    
	void Wallet::withdraw(int val){
		balance -= val;
	}
        </code>
      </pre>

    <h3>Main Class</h3>
    <p>The main class creates two Wallets: myWallet and yourWallet. Each wallet begins with one hundred 
      dollars in its balance, and myWallet has twenty-seven dollars withdrawn. This process is narrated 
      by the program in the standard output.</p>
    <p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            	#include 
	#include "Wallet.h"	//Include the header file once again!

	int main() {
		int startingBal = 100;
    
		//Creating two wallet objects with two distinct balances
		Wallet myWallet;
		Wallet yourWallet;
    
		myWallet.setBalance(startingBal);
		yourWallet.setBalance(startingBal);
    
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"I have " &lt;&lt; myWallet.getBalance() &lt;&lt; " dollars in my wallet!\n";
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"You also have " &lt;&lt; yourWallet.getBalance() &lt;&lt; " dollars.\n";
    
		//Only myWallet's balance will be affected
		myWallet.withdraw(27);
    
		int loseVal = startingBal - myWallet.getBalance();
    
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"I lost " &lt;&lt; loseVal  &lt;&lt; " dollars...\n";
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"Now I have " &lt;&lt; myWallet.getBalance() &lt;&lt; " dollars and you have " &lt;&lt; yourWallet.getBalance() &lt;&lt; " dollars.\n";
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"Lucky you!\n";

		return 0;
	}
        </code>
        <samp> Output: I have 100 dollars in my wallet! You also have 100 dollars. <br />
        I lost 27 dollars... Now I have 73 dollars and you have 100 dollars. Lucky you!
