        <h4>Choosing a Compiler</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>The most mature and compatible C++ compiler is on GCC. It's part of the GNU Compiler Collection. Many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) also include a compiler, but some won't. Users should be aware of this before relying on an IDE to compile their programs.</p></li>
            <li><p>The directions to install GCC compilers can be found at <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Compiler/Where_to_get"> https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Compiler/Where_to_get</a></p></li>
            <li><p>Another compiler that can be used for Mac OS X is Clang. Clang comes with Xcode, so Mac OS X users with Xcode don't need to install anything. Directions to install Xcode on Mac OS X can be found at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-download-and-install-xcode/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-download-and-install-xcode/</a></p></li>
            <li><p>If a quick solution is needed, users can also find an online compiler at <a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler">https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler</a></p></li>
